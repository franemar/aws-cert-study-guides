___

### Advantages of cloud computing

Operating in the AWS Cloud offers many benefits over computing in on-premises or hybrid environments. The six advantages of cloud computing:

- Trade upfront expense for variable expense: upfront expenses include data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using computing resources. Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources.
- Benefit from massive economies of scale: by using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregates in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale. Economies of scale translate into lower pay-as-you-go prices.
- Stop guessing capacity: with cloud computing, you don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application.
- Increase speed and agility: the flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers: cloud computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers.
- Go global in minutes: the AWS Cloud global footprint enables you to quickly deploy applications to customers around the world, while providing them with low latency.

___

## Informática

### Amazon EC2

Elastic Load Balancing
: Is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group.

AWS Instance Scheduler
: es una solución de AWS que permite a los clientes configurar con facilidad una programación personalizada de inicio y detención para sus instancias de Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) y Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). [AWS Instance Scheduler](https://aws.amazon.com/es/solutions/implementations/instance-scheduler/).

#### Amazon Machine Images (AMI)

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations. An AMI includes the following: 

- One or more Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots, or, for instance-store-backed AMIs, a template for the root volume of the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).
- Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
- A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.

___

### AWS Lambda

Los permisos de invocar la función se establecen con IAM Resource Policy/Function Policy y los de ejecutar la función con IAM Execution Role.  De existir una VPC: you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information, which includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs.  Lambda provides a permissions policy named AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole which is an execution role with permissions to create, describe, and delete elastic network interfaces. [Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html)

- [AWS Lambda - Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
- [AWS Lambda Runtimes in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html).  [Custom runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html).
- [SAM and SAM Cli](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model)
- [Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html).  **Nota**: en este tutorial no se indica que se debe iniciar el paquete (*npm init* antes de *npm install sharp*).
- [Lambda Power Tuning](https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning)

#### Use SAM CLI and AWS Cloud9 to Deploy Lambda Functions (Tutorial)

**Nota:** Este tutorial fue creado con la versión anterior a nov. 2020 de Cloud9, donde existía la sección AWS Resources la cual fue sustituida por AWS Toolkit --> ver [Lamdba Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/lambda-toolkit.html).  Es recomendable deshabilitar el Toolkit si no se desea invertir tiempo en el aprendizaje del uso del mismo (aunque es lo que debería hacerse) [deshabilitar Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/toolkit-welcome.html#disable-toolkit).

[Archivo zip del tutorial](Tutoriales/LambdaC9Env.zip)

1. Crear una función Lambda local si es posible con un blueprint vacío.  Esta acción además de crear la carpeta de la aplicación también crea los archivos template.yaml e index.js.
2. Se debe configurar el Test Payload para que las ejecuciones puedan informar por consola (o ser ejecutadas).  Este Payload debe generarse invocando el comando del servicio u operación deseada desde una terminal y con el prefijo "sam local generate-event".
3. Los recursos con los que se desea interactuar (S3, DynamoDB, etc.) deben agregarse a la plantilla template.yaml en la sección "Resources".  **Nota:** siempre que se realicen cambios en la plantilla, se debe ejecutar el comando *sam validate*.
4. En la misma plantilla template.yaml, se debe agregar la información de los *eventos* de los recursos agregados a la sección "Resources", tomando la sintaxis desde AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).  Referenciar los recursos con !Ref <nombre_recurso>.
5. Las políticas de permisos deben ser agregadas a la función.
6. Una vez finalizada todas las ediciones sobre template.yaml, se debe desplegar la función haciendo clic derecho sobre la misma y luego sobre "Deploy" (sección "Lambda" --> "Local functions").
7. Verificar el despliegue de la función en la consola de Lambda.
8. Verificar que los recursos han sido creados (si aplica, S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
9. En index.js, si se desea registrar la información de los eventos, se debe copiar la sintaxis de AWS Developer Guide "Event Message Structure".  Tambien se debe referir a la AWS Developer Guide SDK del lenguaje que se esté usando para por ejemplo, escribir valores en una tabla. **Nota:** pueden aparecer algunos mensajes de advertencia indicando que *x variable* no está definida, en el principio, hacer caso omiso.

**Nota:** cuando la función se crea manualmente, deben crearse también la política de IAM y el rol de ejecución (véase el tutorial *Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3*).

___

### Containers

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
: Is a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. Amazon ECS supports Docker containers.

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
: Is a fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS. *Kubernetes* is open-source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

AWS Fargate
: Is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. When using AWS Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers, AWS Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you.

___

## Infraestructura

[Infraestructura global de AWS](https://www.infrastructure.aws/).

Edge location
: Is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery (CDN: Content Delivery Network).

With **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, you provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:

- Adjust capacity
- Load balancing
- Automatic scaling
- Application health monitoring

With **AWS CloudFormation**, you can treat your infrastructure as code. This means that you can build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources.

AWS Outposts
: Is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to customer premises. An Outpost is a pool of AWS compute and storage capacity deployed at a customer site. AWS operates, monitors, and manages this capacity as part of an AWS Region.

___

### AWS Command Line Interface

[Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

___

## Networking

Internet gateway
: To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an internet gateway to the VPC. An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet. Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within your VPC.

Virtual private gateway
: To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway. The virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC. It acts like a virtual private network (VPN) connection that encrypts (or protects) your internet traffic from all the other requests around it. A virtual private gateway enables you to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection between your VPC and a private network, such as an on-premises data center or internal corporate network. A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.

AWS Direct Connect
: Is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC.

### Subnets

A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private. **Public subnets** contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store’s website. **Private subnets** contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers’ personal information and order histories. In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other.

#### Network traffic in a VPC

The package enters into a VPC through an internet gateway. Before a packet can enter into a subnet or exit from a subnet, it checks for permissions. These permissions indicate who sent the packet and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet. The VPC component that checks packet permissions for subnets is a network access control list (ACL).

Network access control lists (ACLs)
: A network access control list (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. Network ACLs perform *stateless* packet filtering and allows all inbound and outbound traffic. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound. When a packet response for that request comes back to the subnet, the network ACL does not remember your previous request. The network ACL checks the packet response against its list of rules to determine whether to allow or deny.

Security group
: Is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance. By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. You can add custom rules to configure which traffic to allow or deny. If you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within a subnet, you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance. Security groups perform *stateful* packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets. When a packet response for that request returns to the instance, the security group remembers your previous request. The security group allows the response to proceed, regardless of inbound security group rules.

Amazon Route 53
: is a DNS web service. It connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS (such as Amazon EC2 instances and load balancers). It can route users to infrastructure outside of AWS. Another feature of Route 53 is the ability to manage the DNS records for domain names. You can register new domain names directly in Route 53. You can also transfer DNS records for existing domain names managed by other domain registrars. This enables you to manage all of your domain names within a single location.

## Storage

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
: Is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available. An *Amazon EBS volume* stores data in a single Availability Zone. To attach an Amazon EC2 instance to an EBS volume, both the Amazon EC2 instance and the EBS volume must reside within the same Availability Zone.

Amazon EBS snapshots
: You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes.  An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup.

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
: Is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. As you add and remove files, Amazon EFS grows and shrinks automatically. It can scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications. Amazon EFS is a regional service. It stores data in and across multiple Availability Zones. Additionally, on-premises servers can access Amazon EFS using *AWS Direct Connect*.

___

## Seguridad, identidad y conformidad

### Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Los roles son accesos temporales, los permisos se encuentran en las "Policy Docs".

### AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

AWS KMS enables you to perform encryption operations through the use of cryptographic keys. You can use AWS KMS to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys. You can also control the use of keys across a wide range of services and in your applications.

With AWS KMS, you can choose the specific levels of access control that you need for your keys. For example, you can specify which IAM users and roles are able to manage keys. Alternatively, you can temporarily disable keys so that they are no longer in use by anyone. Your keys never leave AWS KMS, and you are always in control of them.

- [Programas de conformidad de AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/es/compliance/).

### AWS Organizations

You can use them to consolidate and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central location.  When you create an organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates a root, which is the parent container for all the accounts in your organization.

Service Control Policies (SCPs)
: By using SCPs in AWS Organizations, you can centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization. SCPs enable you to place restrictions on the AWS services, resources, and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access.

Organizational units (OUs)
: In AWS Organizations, you can group accounts into OUs to make it easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements. When you apply a policy to an OU, all the accounts in the OU automatically inherit the permissions specified in the policy.  By organizing separate accounts into OUs, you can more easily isolate workloads or applications that have specific security requirements.

### AWS Compliance

Risk management, control environment and information security. [Customer Compliance Center.](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/customer-center/)

AWS Artifact
: Is a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. AWS Artifact consists of two main sections: AWS Artifact Agreements and AWS Artifact Reports.

AWS Artifact Agreements
: You can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations. Different types of agreements are offered to address the needs of customers who are subject to specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

AWS Artifact Reports
: Provide compliance reports from third-party auditors. These auditors have tested and verified that AWS is compliant with a variety of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards and regulations. AWS Artifact Reports remains up to date with the latest reports released.
___

### Amazon Inspector

Amazon Inspector tests the network accessibility of your Amazon EC2 instances and the security state of your applications that run on those instances. It assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, it produces a detailed list of security findings that is organized by level of severity.

With Amazon Inspector, you can automate security vulnerability assessments throughout your development and deployment pipelines or for static production systems. This allows you to make security testing a regular part of development and IT operations.

Amazon Inspector also offers predefined software called an agent that you can optionally install in the operating system of the EC2 instances that you want to assess. The agent monitors the behavior of the EC2 instances, including network, file system, and process activity. It also collects a wide set of behavior and configuration data (telemetry).
___

### DDoS Attacks

#### AWS Shield

Protector Agent against DDoS attacks. Provides two levels of protection: Standard and Advanced.

- AWS Shield Standard
: Automatically protects all AWS customers at no cost. It protects your AWS resources from the most common, frequently occurring types of DDoS attacks. As network traffic comes into your applications, AWS Shield Standard uses a variety of analysis techniques to detect malicious traffic in real time and automatically mitigates it.

- AWS Shield Advanced
: Is a paid service that provides detailed attack diagnostics and the ability to detect and mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks. It also integrates with other services such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, and Elastic Load Balancing. Additionally, you can integrate AWS Shield with *AWS WAF* by writing custom rules to mitigate complex DDoS attacks.

AWS WAF
: Is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications. AWS WAF works together with Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer. Recall the network access control, AWS WAF works in a similar way to block or allow traffic. However, it does this by using a web access control list (ACL) to protect your AWS resources.

Amazon GuardDuty
: is a service that provides intelligent threat detection for your AWS infrastructure and resources. It identifies threats by continually monitoring the network activity and account behavior within your AWS environment.

3. Well Architected Framework: helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.  The Well-Architected Framework is based on the next five pillars:
   1. Operational excellence: is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.  
   2. Security: this pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices: automate security best practices when possible, apply security at all layers, protect data in transit and at rest.
   3. Reliability: is the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues. It includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.
   4. Performance efficiency: is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
   5. Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

### 6 strategies for migration

When migrating applications to the cloud, six of the most common migration strategies that you can implement are:

Re-hosting
: It's also known as “lift-and-shift”, involves moving applications without changes.

Re-platforming
: It's also known as “lift, tinker, and shift,” involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.

Refactoring/re-architecting
: It involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features.

Re-purchasing
: It involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model.

Retaining
: It consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment.

Retiring
: It's the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.

### Amazon Athena

It's a serverless service that can query Amazon S3 or almost any other source directly using the Structured Query Language (SQL).

La sintaxis SQL está basada en [Apache Hive]([https://link](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home)) y en [Presto 0.217](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.217/index.html).

- [Tutorial incremental data processing (Hudi)](https://incremental-data-processing-on-amazonemr.workshop.aws/en/10-basics.html), [git repo](https://github.com/andresmaopal/hudi_palacan_demos).  **Nota:** tutorial importante ya que muestra como deben realizarse los comandos sobre hudi, simular la actualización de datos random sobre las fuentes, las instancias EMR, etc.  Lamentablemente además de ser un poco confuso, no se pudo configurar el usuario IAM solicitado por lo que tuvo que realizarse con acceso root.  Sería recomendable revisar si se puede hacer el siguiente--> [Apply record level changes from relational databases to Amazon S3 data lake using Apache Hudi on Amazon EMR and AWS Database Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/big-data/apply-record-level-changes-from-relational-databsiases-to-amazon-s3-data-lake-using-apache-hudi-on-amazon-emr-and-aws-database-migration-service/)

___

### Amazon Glue

It's an auto-managed ETL.  It's recommended to use "Glue Studio".  It's based on Hive.

#### Components

- **Dynamic Frame**: a dynamic frame is similar to an Apache Spark dataframe, which is a data abstraction used to organize data into rows and columns, except that each record is self-describing so no schema is required initially. With dynamic frames, you get schema flexibility and a set of advanced transformations specifically designed for dynamic frames.
