# AWS Certifications curated study guides

## Description

This repo contains the study guides that I have used for previous AWS certifications or those that I am currently using to pursue new AWS certifications.  The main goal of this repo would be to become the free and unoficial study guides for AWS Certifications, but there are a few Github repositories that try to achieve the same goal.  The reasons why I chose to start a new repository are several, but I could mention a few: 1) unlicensed repositories, 2) outdated study guides, 3) all the guide content published in the README, 4) my personal urgency, etc.

**Notes:**

1. At this moment, all the guides are out of date.  The guide that will be udpated soon is *SAA-C03*.
2. My native language is not English, so if you find any misuse of the language, I appreciate it if you can send me an issue, so I can proceed to fix it.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute, you can do it in the same way as any other project: with issues, with direct fixes, etc., but, if you are currently studying for an AWS certification and would like to reuse, collaborate or even add a new guide, you are totally welcome for that.  If this is your case, please create an issue and I will get back to you ASAP.
